        ## Summary
        A recursive function solves a problem by calling itself on a smaller version of it. Each call gets its own frame on the call stack, which holds that call's arguments and local variables. The calls pause in order until a base case returns, then the stack unwinds and each paused call finishes its work.

        ## Key points
        - Every recursive function needs a base case that returns without calling itself.
        - Each call waits for the one it made, so the most recent call finishes first.
        - Without a base case the stack keeps growing until it overflows.
        - Tracing factorial(3) frame by frame is the skill the midterm tests.

        ## Definitions
        - **Call stack**: the memory a program uses to track calls that haven't finished yet.
        - **Stack frame**: one entry on the stack: a call's arguments, locals and where to return.
        - **Base case**: the input a recursive function answers directly.

        ## Questions to review
        1. Draw the stack for factorial(4) at its deepest point.
        2. What happens if the base case is n == 1 and you call factorial(0)?
